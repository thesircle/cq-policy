Note: for Pakistan office, only contact the manager there. Do not contact HR, DevOps, Admin or Accounts depts unless your are contacted by them for any specific matter.

This policy may change time to time and it is the responsibiilty of employee to track the changes. 

If a policy clause is not addressed to a specific group/team, it means it is for all.

Specific contract and offers override general practices and policies but if something is not mentioned in your offer and contract or in any explicit communication, the following policies apply to you. This is the normal sequence. You should not cherrypick terms yourself.

Office timing
---------------
#### For group POB:
Office timings are 8am to 6pm (8-9 productive working hours + 1 hour break (depending on batch and offer)) for five-six days a week (Monday to Friday OR Monday to Saturday (different batches))
#### For group FIB:
Flexible timings and result oriented scheme. As of now, there are no office timings, however, its good to sync up with your manager on timings. Weekly targets and results matter more rather than office timings.
* Work slot #1: Under development
* work slot #2: 4.5 productive working hours a day, 6 days a week. You just have to show productivity of 27 hours a week (6 days x 4.5 hrs). No hard and fast rules to work exactly 4.5 hours a day (though it IS recommended to). You may adjust few  (minimum possible) hours up and down in a day and work on weekend if you like but one week's targets should not go out of control.
* work slot #3: 9 productive working hours a day, 6 days a week. You just have to show productivity of 54 hours a week (6 days x 9 hrs). No hard and fast rules to work exactly 9 hours a day (though it IS recommended to). You may adjust few  (minimium possible) hours up and down in a day and work on weekend if you like but one week's targets should not go out of control.
* work slot #4: 2.25 productive working hours a day, 6 days a week. Same as above.

NOTE: productive working hours are hours you use for productivity. These do not include break time.

Break
------

#### For group POB:
* Break timings are 1pm to 2:15pm on Fridays and 1pm to 2pm on all other days.
* Taking a break for minimum of 30 minutes is compulsory for all employees. One of the reasons of this is that without such amount of rest, the health of employee and work performance may go down. Unhealthy employee is unhealthy employer.

Such employees may not be adversely affected in any manner related to their employment . Such retaliation is also illegal under legal laws of Pakistan.

The employer views harassment and retaliation to be among the most serious breaches of workplace behavior. Consequently, appropriate disciplinary or corrective action, ranging from a warning to termination and more, can be expected.


DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE

* The Employee must send a copy of their notice to CQ's address or email it to hr@cqtechnologies.com
* In some cases, employees do not work dedicatedly or take leaves. Usuall threashold of this is equivalence to 3 days absense in a month. In such cases, CQ reserves the right to treat it as misconduct and consider the employee just stopped working without giving proper notice. For example employee unwilling to work cooperatively and had decided in his/her heart to leave CQ any way but is blackmailing for notice period (just passing time). In these cases, the employee will also be liable to penalities that might have incurred if he had just stopped working suddently.
* CQ also reserves the right to monitor screen activity of the employee in this case and in any normal case as well with intention to train or mere intention to monitor.
* It is correct that such cases are hard to explain or justify. The employer may terminate this Agreement and the Employee’s employment at any time due to misconduct, inadequate performance or behavior or no reason at all and may not give any notice period or additional pay (other than the duration the employee had worked in office).

#### For group POB:
Notice periods

* The minimum notice period by employee should be at least 0.5 month in case of both permanent and probationary period. If employee is not able to give this notice period due to any reason then he/she is bound to return salary equivalent to the notice period to CQ as compensation to losses incurred by CQ due to employee’s early leaving.
* The employee may leave the company without notice within the first week of probationary period and the employer can also terminate employment without notice in the first week of probationary period.
* A VIOLATION WILL RESULT IN WITHHELD SALARY AND/OR PROVIDENT FUND AND ALSO HIS/HER OUTSTANDING SALARY IF ANY WILL BE REVOKED.
* In case of termination of permanent employee by the CQ, CQ will either give a 0.5 month advance notice period to the permanent employee OR 0.5 month's advance salary to the permanent employee with the condition to leave immediately. In the case of the Employee being dismissed for gross misconduct, CQ will decide if any notice period will be applied and/or worked and also reserves the right to withhold 0.5 month's salary. An example, but not limited to, of such a case is, employee unwilling to work cooperatively and had decided in his/her heart to leave CQ any way but is blackmailing for notice period.

Resource guidance on work
-------------------------

* Strategy, code, attitude and work should be "relevant" to "requirements" rather than only "interesting" or "relevant" to resources' personal interests.
* We do not take responsibility that "everything" enforced in CQ will be felt "pleasureful" and "enjoyable" to resources. For example, we (or any firm in the world) cannot implement "all" best practices and standards of industry (though valid). As a side note, still there is a worldwide debate on best practices, we think there is no single standard or law as practical/practice may differ to each country, culture, firm's clients, firms's policies and values.
* Junior developers are advised to discuss with manager before implementing any strategy/ design/ design pattern/ feature
* Code commenting is "required" and is good but excess of everything is bad. Too much commenting on things those are self or should have been self explanatory by better logic and naming conventions, is not the worth of time.


Disclaimers
-----------

* It is implied that management had put best effort to arrange "intentions" to "words", however, as humans; there may be occasions where the resource assumes something else and the intention of management is something else. Management can explain the true meaning of the discussion in subject or elaborate things those are not written or briefly written or have other implications related to the said.
* Under few circumstances, any of the above said policy may be made void, unenforceable or contrary if decided by management
* This policy is subject to change by sole discretion of management and employees agree to be bound by changes made from time to time.
* Employee should followup with policy changes by him/herself and object in writing if any policy is totally not agreeable by him/her. Otherwise it would be implied that the policy, the changes made in policy from time to time are agreed by the employee.


Fixed and incentive based team FIB:
===================================

#### Better salary
We try to give better salary in this section. Lets say we think the candidate is worth of or the candidate is already taking 90k from his/her current employer. We will remunerate 100k (10% extra) but this is in two parts. 60 fixed, 40 variable.

#### Salary calculation
60% is fixed and 40% is variable incentive efficiency based. If there are 4 weeks in a month. Fixed per week = 60 / 4 = 15. Bonus = 40 / 4 = 10. Total per week 15+10 = 25.

#### What is bonus/ incentive and how to get it
For each task/project/ ticket assigned etc, the dev and his/her manager sits down and mutually conclude estimated hours on fair bases. Well, this part is usual or should be usual any way in any organization for planning and deliverables etc.

Suppose the employee has to work for 27 hours (4.5 hrs a day, 6 days a week) and the tasks assigned to him and completed are also somewhat equal to 27 hours. He has earned 15+10=25 of his salary but let's say there was a huge difference. He did only 50% of the tasks, Looks like he would get just 15 (the fixed part) and no bonus.

4 weeks fixed and bouns makes up his monthly salary.

#### Why not just fixed salary like most companies do?
One of the only effective ways to measure the hardwork and loyalty of resource is by results.

By this we can benefit more hardworking and loyal candidates. As you know, skillfull, loyal and hardworking people usually don't have to worry a lot as their work speaks from themselves.

#### What if I complete my tasks way ahead of time?
If someone completes tasks even earlier than ETA, he gets even more bonus by starting next week (virtually) or he can rest. But honestly, it would be rare as the overall salary package would be already according to the skill level of the employee. Either way, if tasks are completed on or before time, no further work is required (until the candidate wants to work more, which is welcomed and he will get additional salary).

If you are completing tasks in lesser time than the ETA, that means, you are performing more than expectations. In this case, you can apply for an appraisal. An appraisal will increase your basic salary and bonus band, expect more from you, raise your designation.

#### What if I need time to give estimates, in the first place, for the task?
The reasonable time taken in estimation is itself a task and will have an ETA. This will be added to the list of tasks to be done.

#### What if the manager thinks a task should be done in less amount of time and I think I would need more time.
With stats of almost every company, this is normal, in any scenario. Managers and company want more and more efficiency (sometimes just pressing without logic) and resources usually have a different percpetive influenced by (comfort zones, unkown contingency/stuck issues, extra/buffer time). This sentance may have sounded negative but these are some realities of few  if not all(managers/companies and resources).

However, we try to do best to maintain harmony. Its understood that realistic and practicality of ETA of tasks and the resource actually realizing and getting the bonus if he had worked hard, is the key to success here.

The only way we see, as a solution, is both managers and resources to communicate their percpectives in a logical way and also for few moments, consider analysing things exchanging percpectives (managers to think like resources and resouorces to understand managers perspective).

#### What if I got sick or busy somewhere and was not able to engage for few days.
You have to compensate the work hours next week (or later in future) to get the complete salary and bonus.

#### I worked for 27 hours a week and I was expected for the same hours (the estimation of tasks was also 27 hours), but I was not able to acheive anything.
Asuuming that you and manager and mutually agreed that the said tasks will be done in 27 hour, there are two outcomes of this:
1. You let your manager know the genuine reasons why the tasks were not completed, he may increase the estimations and /or mark whatever you have done as "comppleted and accepted" if he get convinced.
1. If the reasons you state are not justified, we have no means to measure the genuiness. It will be considered as you have not worked at all.

#### I worked for the 27 hours expected but I was not able to complete and get the equivalent tasks expected. Some tasks were complete and approved but not all.
You will get basic fixed salary of 60/4weeks=15 in our example, and no bonus as bonus is for fully completed tasks for the week.
